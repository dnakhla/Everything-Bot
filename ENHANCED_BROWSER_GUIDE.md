# 🚀 Enhanced Browser Tool - Smart Navigation

## 🎯 **What We Fixed**

The user was **absolutely right** - the previous browser tool was too passive. When asked to find match results, it should:

1. ✅ **Find clickable elements** (Week 10, match links, etc.)
2. ✅ **Click through navigation** automatically 
3. ✅ **Extract the actual data** behind the links
4. ✅ **Return comprehensive results**

## 🛠️ **New Actions Added**

### **1. `find-clickables`** - Discover Navigation Options
```javascript
browser("https://mltt.com/schedule", "find-clickables", {
  instruction: "week 10 Carolina vs Seattle"
})
```

**Returns:**
```
🖱️ Clickable Elements Found (25 total, 8 relevant):

Most Relevant Clickables:
1. a: "Week 10" (score: 8)
   Selector: `a[href*="week"]:nth-of-type(10)`
   URL: https://mltt.com/schedule/week-10

2. a: "Carolina Gold Rush vs Seattle Spinners" (score: 12)
   Selector: `.match a:nth-of-type(3)`
   URL: https://mltt.com/matches/carolina-seattle-week10
```

### **2. `smart-navigate`** - Automatic Deep Navigation 
```javascript
browser("https://mltt.com/schedule", "smart-navigate", {
  instruction: "Carolina Gold Rush vs Seattle Spinners match result and Golden Game score"
})
```

**What it does:**
1. 🔍 **Scans page** for clickable elements related to "Carolina", "Seattle", "week", "match"
2. 🖱️ **Clicks most relevant links** (e.g., Week 10, match details)
3. 📄 **Analyzes new content** for the requested information
4. 🔄 **Tries up to 3 different navigation paths** if first attempt fails
5. ✅ **Returns actual match results** with scores and details

- Scores clickables based on relevance to user query
- Handles team names, week numbers, match terminology

### **Automatic Navigation:**
- Clicks through up to 3 most relevant elements
- Waits for page loads and network idle
