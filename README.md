## üß† How It Works: The Intelligent Agent

More than just a chatbot, this bot operates as a sophisticated AI agent capable of complex reasoning and tool utilization. When you pose a question, it follows a dynamic process:

1.  **Understanding Intent:** The AI analyzes your query to grasp its core meaning and context.
2.  **Strategic Tool Selection:** It intelligently determines the optimal tool or sequence of tools required (e.g., a web search followed by summarization, or a Reddit search for public sentiment).
3.  **Information Gathering:** The bot executes the chosen tools, collecting and accumulating relevant data and context from each operation.
4.  **Synthesized Response:** Finally, it synthesizes all gathered information into a concise, conversational, and easy-to-understand response, delivered naturally as a series of short Telegram messages.

This multi-step, adaptive approach allows for highly accurate and nuanced answers, far surpassing the capabilities of traditional single-prompt AI systems.

*   A **Brave API Key** (optional, for Brave Search).
*   **Node.js** (version 16.0.0 or later) installed locally.
*   **AWS CLI** installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies**
    ```bash

        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Fill in your API keys and other configurations in the `.env` file.
    *   Use the provided `set-env` script to upload these variables to your Lambda function:
        ```bash
        npm run set-env -- --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME --region your-region
        ```
    *   **Required Environment Variables:**
        *   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
        *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
